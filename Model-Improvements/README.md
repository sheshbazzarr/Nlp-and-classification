# Model improvements - Lesson overview

- Model improvements are crucial in data science for enhancing the **accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **generalisability** of predictive
models. These advancements enable practitioners to tackle **complex challenges** in classification, dealing with **imbalanced
datasets** , and optimising **model parameters** for superior outcomes.

- In this lesson, we will cover a range of techniques, from **feature subset selection**and **hyperparameter tuning**to addressing
**class imbalance**and introducing multiclass classification strategies. We'll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to
refine logistic regression models, utilise advanced tuning methods, and effectively manage dataset peculiarities for improved
model performance.
